This lesson is based on the video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mvAbWWn1cTk

NOTES:
    1- Prior to do anything in this lesson it is recommendable to install the VS Code plugin "live server". 
        In the video he says it wrong, he says the extension "live reload", but live server is the one you need.
    2- It is necessary to do in the terminal (in the directory of the lesson) "npm init -y" to start the repository 
        in the lesson. This generates the file package.json that keeps track of the JS packages installed by NPM.
    3- Download Phaser: Open the terminal (in the directory of the lesson) and type "npm install --save phaser". This
        downloads and install phaser, now you will see that in the file package.json in the dependencies section, the
        packet "phaser" has been added.
    4- A ".gitignore" file based on the github template "Node" has been added to the repository therefore all the files
        created with npm are not stored in the code repository. This makes the repository cleaner and more efficient.
